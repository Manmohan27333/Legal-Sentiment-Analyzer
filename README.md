# Legal-Sentiment-Analyzer
This project is an AI-based tool that analyzes the sentiment of legal documents. It tells whether the text is positive, negative, or neutral. The tool also gives a short summary of the document to help understand it quickly. Itâ€™s designed to save time for legal teams by reducing manual document review.
